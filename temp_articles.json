A feasibility study is currently underway, and our dealer network has also shown keen interest in the two-wheelers,” Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia, told reporters.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In September, the company had officially launched two electric cars in India – the VF 6 and VF 7 – and plans to launch a new model every six months in the country, Chau said, adding that the next model will be launched in February. In the first quarter of 2026, VinFast will also launch its ride hailing operations in India, looking to translate the service’s success in its home country of Vietnam, where it offers its electric cars to a ride hailing fleet operated by GSM.</span></p><p><br></p><p>Beyond passenger mobility, the company is also in talks with states like Maharashtra,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chennai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 152); background-color: initial;\">Tamil Nadu</a>, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, among others, to launch electric buses in the country.</p><p><br></p><p>Chau said that Vingroup – one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, of which VinFast is a part – is exploring bringing its entire ecosystem to India, spanning from mobility to education and healthcare to hospitality. In Vietnam, the company has businesses in residential townships, schools, universities, hospitals, resorts, and transportation, among others.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In India, VinFast is betting big on the nascent, but growing EV market with its recently inaugurated assembly plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, marking the start of a phased investment of up to Rs 16,000 crore. Here, the company’s strategy to domestically manufacture in India has been different from that of Tesla’s, which is currently only looking at the country as a sales market.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Chau said that VinFast sees India as a crucial market for its global expansion ambitions, and will also serve as an export hub for the company.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To serve its electric cars, the company has tied up with partners to offer charging solutions to its customers, but Chau said that the company was open to the possibility of building its own charging infrastructure, something it has already done at scale in Vietnam. He added that VinFast was open to multiple financing options to make its cars more lucrative for prospective buyers.</span></p><p><br></p>"},"featuredImage":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dizmhh4hh/image/upload/v1764575596/articles/dwbz0veu2dtckhxjufdl.avif","alt":"Vietnam’s VinFast to launch electric 2-wheelers in India in 2026, feasibility studies underway"},"meta":{"keywords":[]},"location":{"district":"Unknown","country":"India","state":"Bihar","city":""},"_id":"692d4970bfba35269a0ffd47","author":{"name":"prabha","email":"prabha@gmail.com"},"category":"Business","tags":[],"language":"en","isBreaking":false,"status":"published","youtubeVideoId":null,"publishAt":"2025-12-01T07:53:15.191Z","views":23,"readingTimeMinutes":3,"images":[],"slug":"vietnams-vinfast-to-launch-electric-2-wheelers-in-india-in-2026-feasibility-studies-underway","createdAt":"2025-12-01T07:53:20.459Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-01T09:58:47.756Z","__v":0},{"title":{"en":"As BCCI pushes for seniors to play domestic cricket, Virat Kohli says, ‘I’ve never been a big believer of lot of preparation’","hi":"As BCCI pushes for seniors to play domestic cricket, Virat Kohli says, ‘I’ve never been a big believer of lot of preparation’"},"summary":{"en":"His 52nd hundred showcased his famed fitness, mental strength and drive and he says that s long as he's hitting the ball well, he can keep performing","hi":"His 52nd hundred showcased his famed fitness, mental strength and drive and he says that s long as he's hitting the ball well, he can keep performing"},"content":{"en":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">After his&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa-live-cricket-score-1st-odi-ind-vs-sa-match-scorecard-jsca-international-stadium-ranchi-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-10393994\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 98, 152); background-color: initial;\">commanding statement with the bat, Virat Kohli</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;gave one straight and a few subtle clarifications.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose from 6.47 percent to 6.52 percent on Friday, reflecting the market’s assessment that monetary easing may be off the table for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Barclays said it no longer expects a rate cut at the December 5 policy meeting, noting that the robust growth numbers outweigh the impact of unusually low October inflation.

Higher crude prices are negative for India as they raise import costs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6) November PMI hits 9-month low:</strong>&nbsp;Despite faster growth in the September quarter, the manufacturing sector lost steam in November, with industrial activity easing to its weakest level in nine months, according to a survey released Monday.

The rupee declined to 89.76 against the US dollar, dipping past its previous record low of 89.49 hit about two weeks back.&nbsp;Rupee has depreciated nearly 90 paise against US dollar since November 3</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2) RBI rate cut seen unlikely:&nbsp;</strong>Stronger-than-expected GDP growth has reduced expectations of a near-term rate cut by the RBI. The benchmark 10-year bond yield rose from 6.47 percent to 6.52 percent on Friday, reflecting the market’s assessment that monetary easing may be off the table for now.</p><p><br></p><p>Barclays said it no longer expects a rate cut at the December 5 policy meeting, noting that the robust growth numbers outweigh the impact of unusually low October inflation. The brokerage expects the central bank to maintain a pause while sounding dovish and revising up its growth forecast.</p><p><br></p><p>Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said the economy \"doesn’t need a monetary stimulus when it is firing on all cylinders\", adding that this has acted as a dampener for sentiment.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/strong-q2-gdp-impresses-street-but-experts-say-dec-rate-cut-by-rbi-unlikely-13703619.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Strong Q2 GDP impresses D-Street, but experts say Dec rate cut by RBI seems unlikely</strong></a></p><p><strong>3) Weak global cues:&nbsp;</strong>Asian markets were subdued, with South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei 225 trading lower. Wall Street futures were down by up to 1 percent, signalling a weak start for the US markets.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stock-market-live-sensex-nifty-50-share-price-gift-nifty-latest-updates-01-12-2025-liveblog-13703452.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stock Market LIVE Updates</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>4) FII selling:&nbsp;</strong>Foreign investors turn sellers of Indian equities in November, their fourth month of selling in five months. The FIIs sold equities worth Rs 3,795.72 crore on Friday. Persistent FII outflows typically weigh on domestic markets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5) Rise in crude oil prices:&nbsp;</strong>Brent crude gained 1.62 percent to USD 63.39 per barrel. Higher crude prices are negative for India as they raise import costs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6) November PMI hits 9-month low:</strong>&nbsp;Despite faster growth in the September quarter, the manufacturing sector lost steam in November, with industrial activity easing to its weakest level in nine months, according to a survey released Monday. Analysts at HSBC said GDP growth may slow noticeably in the March quarter as the temporary lift from GST-related consumption wanes, fiscal spending moderates and export momentum weakens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.
